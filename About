Three layered unidirectional orthotropic laminate is designed in MATLAB. Stress and Strain distributions are invastigated under loading condition.
Tsai-Wu and Hill failure criterias are used to determine first-ply failure.

Laminate.m file is main file
Qij is transformed stiffness matrix function
T is transformation function.
Stiff is stiffness matrix function include extension and sher coupling
